#### Both the present perfect simple and present perfect continuous talk about something which started in the past. 
-   The present perfect simple is a completed action which has a result in the present:  
	She’s passed her driving test, so now she can take the children to the day care centre herself.
- The present perfect continuous is an action which is still  happening now:
	They’ve been working hard on their presentation, but it isn’t finished yet.
